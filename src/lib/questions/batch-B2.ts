    {
        "question": "In each of the following sentences, there is one word or group of words in bracket. From the list of words or group of words lettered A to D, choose the one that is most nearly opposite in meaning to the word in bracket that will, at the same time correctly fill the gap in the sentence.**Dishonest traders sell[fake] products instead of _____ ones.**",
        "options": [
            "A) Costly",
            "B) Durable",
            "C) Genuine",
            "D) Perfect"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "C",

            "D) 4x² + 13x - 12 = 0"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "explanation": "For an equation with roots p and q, the form is x² - (p+q)x + pq = 0. With roots ¾ and -4, we get 4x² - 13x - 12 = 0 when multiplied by 4 to remove fractions."

        "question": "In each of the following sentences, there is one word or group of words in bracket. From the list of words or group of words lettered A to D, choose the one that is most nearly opposite in meaning to the word in bracket that will, at the same time correctly fill the gap in the sentence.**Parents should[persuade] their children to do chores not _____ them.**",
        "options": [
            "A) Implore",

            "D) 400 N/m²"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "D",
        "explanation": "Pressure = Force/Area. Maximum pressure occurs on the smallest face (0.5m × 1.0m = 0.5m²). So maximum pressure = 200N/0.5m² = 400 N/m²."

            "D) -37/48"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "D",
        "explanation": "m/n = 4/9, 1 7/9 = 16/9, n/r = 9/16. So 4/9 - 16/9 + 9/16 = 4/9 - 16/9 + 9/16 = -12/9 + 9/16 = -64/48 + 27/48 = -37/48."
    },
    {
