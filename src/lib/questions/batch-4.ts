            "D) N15.00"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let x be the cost of a notebook and y be the cost of a pen. Then: 3x + y = 35 and 2x + 2y = 30. From the second equation, x + y = 15. Substituting this into the first equation: 3x + y = 35, 3x + (15 - x) = 35, 2x = 20, x = 10. Therefore, y = 15 - 10 = 5."
