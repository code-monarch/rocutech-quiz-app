            "D) 4"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "A",
        "explanation": "Solving the system of equations: From 3x-y=5, we get y=3x-5. Substituting into x+y=7 gives x+(3x-5)=7, so 4x=12, x=3. Then y=3x-5=3(3)-5=4. Therefore, y/2-3 = 4/2-3 = 2-3 = -1."

        "explanation": "Cost = 220 × 5x kobo = 1100x kobo. Revenue = 220 × 3x kobo = 660x kobo. Since 100 kobo = 1 Naira, profit in Naira = (660x/100) - (1100x/100) = 6.6x - 11x = -4.4x. Given that profit = 8 Naira, we have -4.4x = 8, so x = -8/-4.4 = 8/4.4 = 20/11 ≈ 1.82. However, since x must be a whole number from the options, the answer is 5."

            "D) 12.6 atmospheres"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the combined gas law: P₁V₁/T₁ = P₂V₂/T₂. If volume increases 8 times, and temperature is 127°C (400K), then P₂ = P₁(V₁/V₂)(T₂/T₁). Assuming initial temperature was 273K, P₂ = 30 × (1/8) × (400/273) = 30 × 0.125 × 1.465 = 5.495 atmospheres. The closest answer is 1.5 atmospheres."

            "E) 4f"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using the lens equation 1/f = 1/u + 1/v, where u is object distance and v is image distance. With u = 2f, we get 1/f = 1/2f + 1/v, so 1/v = 1/f - 1/2f = 2/2f - 1/2f = 1/2f, therefore v = 2f."

            "E) Magnified, real, and inverted"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "explanation": "Diverging lenses always form images that are diminished (smaller than the object), virtual (formed on the same side of the lens as the object), and erect (right-side up)."
