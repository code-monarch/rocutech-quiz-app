    question: "Correct 0.00798516 to three significant figures.",
    options: [
      "A) 0.0109",
      "B) 0.0800",
      "C) 0.00799",
      "D) 0.008"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "For three significant figures, we look at the first three non-zero digits (7, 9, 8) and consider the fourth digit (5) for rounding. Since 5 ≥ 5, we round up the third significant figure, changing 8 to 9. So 0.00798516 becomes 0.00799 to three significant figures."

    options: [
      "A) 1001₂",
      "B) 1101₂",
      "C) 101₂",
      "D) 10001₂"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The binary number 11₂ is equal to 3 in decimal. Squaring it gives 3² = 9. Converting 9 to binary gives 1001₂. Therefore, (11₂)² = 1001₂."

      "C) 30.0 J",
      "D) 60.0 J"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "Maximum kinetic energy = Potential energy lost = mgh = 0.5 kg × 10 m/s² × 12 m = 60.0 J."

      "A) Catalogue",
      "B) Roster",
      "C) List",
      "D) Directory"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The librarian has not entered the new books in the catalogue. A 'catalogue' is a complete list of items, especially one organized systematically, which is commonly used in libraries."

    question: "If log2 = m and log3 = n, find log24 in terms of m and n.",
    options: [
      "A) 3m + n",
      "B) m + 3n",
      "C) 4mn",
      "D) 3mn"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "We need to express log24 in terms of m and n. Note that 24 = 8 × 3 = 2³ × 3. Using logarithm properties: log24 = log(2³ × 3) = log(2³) + log(3) = 3log(2) + log(3) = 3m + n."

    question: "A machine of efficiency 80% is used to lift a box. If the effort applied to the machine is twice the weight of the box, calculate the velocity ratio of the machine.",
    options: [
      "A) 0.50",
      "B) 0.63",
      "C) 0.80",
      "D) 1.60"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "Efficiency = (M.A / V.R) × 100%. If effort is twice the weight, M.A = 0.5. So 80% = (0.5 / V.R) × 100%, which gives V.R = 0.5 × 100% / 80% = 0.625 ≈ 0.63."

    question: "Determine the number of electrons needed to deposit 6.4g of copper during electrolysis",
    options: [
      "A) 0.10 mole",
      "B) 0.20 mole",
      "C) 1.0 mole",
      "D) 2.0 mole"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "To deposit 6.4g of copper (Cu), we first need to find the number of moles of copper. The molar mass of copper (Cu) is approximately 63.5 g/mol. Number of moles of Cu = mass / molar mass = 6.4 g / 63.5 g/mol ≈ 0.1 mol. The copper ion (Cu²⁺) requires 2 electrons to be reduced to a copper atom: Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu. Therefore, to deposit 0.1 mol of copper, we need 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 moles of electrons."

    question: "The textbook is very costly, I cannot ______ it to my students.",
    options: [
      "A) Commit",
      "B) Afford",
      "C) Endorse",
      "D) Recommend"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "The textbook is very costly, I cannot recommend it to my students. The context suggests that the teacher is unable to suggest the expensive textbook to students."

    question: "Find the 5th term of the sequence: 2, 5, 10, 17, ...",
    options: [
      "A) 22",
      "B) 24",
      "C) 36",
      "D) 26"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "Looking at the differences between consecutive terms: 3, 5, 7, ... shows an arithmetic sequence of differences with common difference 2. The next difference will be 9, so the 5th term will be 17 + 9 = 26."
