      "A) 0.0109",
      "B) 0.0800",
      "C) 0.00799",
      "D) 0.008"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "For three significant figures, we look at the first three non-zero digits (7, 9, 8) and consider the fourth digit (5) for rounding. Since 5 ≥ 5, we round up the third significant figure, changing 8 to 9. So 0.00798516 becomes 0.00799 to three significant figures."

    "question": "A machine of efficiency 80% is used to lift a box. If the effort applied to the machine is twice the weight of the box, calculate the velocity ratio of the machine.",
    "options": [
      "A) 0.50",

      "C) 0.80",
      "D) 1.60"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Efficiency = (M.A / V.R) × 100%. If effort is twice the weight, M.A = 0.5. So 80% = (0.5 / V.R) × 100%, which gives V.R = 0.5 × 100% / 80% = 0.625 ≈ 0.63."

    "question": "Determine the number of electrons needed to deposit 6.4g of copper during electrolysis",
    "options": [
      "A) 0.10 mole",
      "B) 0.20 mole",
      "C) 1.0 mole",
      "D) 2.0 mole"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "To deposit 6.4g of copper(Cu), we first need to find the number of moles of copper.The molar mass of copper(Cu) is approximately 63.5 g / mol. Number of moles of Cu = mass / molar mass = 6.4 g / 63.5 g / mol ≈ 0.1 mol. The copper ion(Cu²⁺) requires 2 electrons to be reduced to a copper atom: Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu. Therefore, to deposit 0.1 mol of copper, we need 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 moles of electrons."

      "C) 36",
      "D) 26"
    ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
        "explanation": "Looking at the differences between consecutive terms: 5-2=3, 10-5=5, 17-10=7. The differences increase by 2 each time. So the next difference would be 7+2=9, making the 5th term 17+9=26."

    ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
        "explanation": "The thermometer has a multiplicative error factor of 102.5/100 = 1.025. So at 55°C, it will register 55 × 1.025 = 56.375°C ≈ 56.4°C."
