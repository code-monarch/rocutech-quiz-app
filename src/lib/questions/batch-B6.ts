    options: [
      "A) Generous",
      "B) Kind",
      "C) Humane",

    question: "Find the value of x for which 32₄ = 22ₓ",
    options: [
      "A) Three",
      "B) Five",
      "C) Six",
      "D) Seven"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "32 in base 4 equals 3×4¹ + 2×4⁰ = 12 + 2 = 14 in base 10. So we need 22 in base x to equal 14, which means 2×x¹ + 2×x⁰ = 14. This simplifies to 2x + 2 = 14, so 2x = 12, and x = 6."

    question: "If x : y : z = 2 : 3 : 4, evaluate (9x + 3y)/(6z - 2y)",
    options: [
      "A) 1 ½",
      "B) 2",
      "C) 2 ½",
      "D) 3"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "If x : y : z = 2 : 3 : 4, then we can substitute x = 2k, y = 3k, z = 4k. So (9x + 3y)/(6z - 2y) = (9(2k) + 3(3k))/(6(4k) - 2(3k)) = (18k + 9k)/(24k - 6k) = 27k/18k = 3/2 = 1½."

    question: "Which of the following compounds can be represented by the molecular formula C₂H₆O?",
    options: [
      "A) Propanol",
      "B) Ethanol",
      "C) Methanoic acid",
      "D) Glucose"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "Ethanol (C₂H₅OH) has the molecular formula C₂H₆O. Propanol would be C₃H₈O, methanoic acid is HCOOH (CH₂O₂), and glucose is C₆H₁₂O₆."

    question: "Simplify: √108 + √125 - √75",
    options: [
      "A) √3 + 5√5",
      "B) 6√3 - 5√5",
      "C) 6√3 + √2",
      "D) 6√3 - √2"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "√108 = √(36 × 3) = 6√3, √125 = √(25 × 5) = 5√5, √75 = √(25 × 3) = 5√3. So √108 + √125 - √75 = 6√3 + 5√5 - 5√3 = √3 + 5√5."

    question: "A wire, 1.0 m long and with a cross-sectional area of 2.0 × 10⁻⁷m², has a resistance of 0.1 Ω. Calculate the electrical conductivity of the material of the wire.",
    options: [
      "A) 2.0 × 10⁷Ω⁻¹m⁻¹",
      "B) 5.0 × 10⁷Ω⁻¹m⁻¹",
      "C) 2.0 × 10³Ω⁻¹m⁻¹",
      "D) 5.0 × 10³Ω⁻¹m⁻¹"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "Conductivity (σ) = L/(R×A) where L is length, R is resistance, and A is cross-sectional area. So σ = 1.0/(0.1×2.0×10⁻⁷) = 5.0×10⁷ Ω⁻¹m⁻¹."

      "B) 42.2%",
      "C) 50.0%",
      "D) 52.5%"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "Boys playing football: 60% of 250 = 150 boys\nGirls playing football: 40% of 150 = 60 girls\nTotal playing football: 210 students\nTotal students: 400\nPercentage = (210/400) × 100 = 52.5%"
