    "question": "In each of the following sentences, there is one word or group of words in bracket. From the list of words or group of words lettered A to D, choose the one that is most nearly opposite in meaning to the word in bracket that will, at the same time correctly fill the gap in the sentence. **Michael is [stingy] but his brother is _______**",
    "options": [
      "A) Generous",
      "B) Kind",
      "C) Humane",
      "D) Hospitable"

    "question": "Find the value of x for which 32₄ = 22ₓ",
    "options": [
      "A) Three",
      "B) Five",
      "C) Six",
      "D) Seven"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "32 in base 4 equals 3×4¹ + 2×4⁰ = 12 + 2 = 14 in base 10. So we need 22 in base x to equal 14, which means 2×x¹ + 2×x⁰ = 14. This simplifies to 2x + 2 = 14, so 2x = 12, and x = 6."

      "B) 2",
      "C) 2 ½",
      "D) 3"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "If x : y : z = 2 : 3 : 4, then we can substitute x = 2k, y = 3k, z = 4k. So (9x + 3y)/(6z - 2y) = (9(2k) + 3(3k))/(6(4k) - 2(3k)) = (18k + 9k)/(24k - 6k) = 27k/18k = 3/2 = 1½."

      "C) 6√3 + √2",
      "D) 6√3 - √2"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "√108 = √(36 × 3) = 6√3, √125 = √(25 × 5) = 5√5, √75 = √(25 × 3) = 5√3. So √108 + √125 - √75 = 6√3 + 5√5 - 5√3 = √3 + 5√5."

      "D) 5.0 × 10³Ω⁻¹m⁻¹"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Conductivity (σ) = L/(R×A) where L is length, R is resistance, and A is cross-sectional area. So σ = 1.0/(0.1×2.0×10⁻⁷) = 5.0×10⁷ Ω⁻¹m⁻¹."

      "C) 50.0%",
      "D) 52.5%"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Number of boys playing football = 0.6 × 250 = 150. Number of girls playing football = 0.4 × 150 = 60. Total playing football = 150 + 60 = 210. Total students = 250 + 150 = 400. Percentage = (210/400) × 100 = 52.5%."

      "A) 2",
      "B) 3",
      "C) 4",
      "D) 5"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "log₁₀(6x - 4) - log₁₀ 2 = 1 means log₁₀((6x - 4)/2) = 1. This gives (6x - 4)/2 = 10¹ = 10. So 6x - 4 = 20, and x = 4."
