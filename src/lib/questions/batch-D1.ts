    question: "The mass of an element is 27, and its atomic number is 13. What is the composition of the nucleus of its atom?",
    options: [
      "A) 13 electrons and 14 protons",
      "B) 13 neutrons and 14 protons",
      "C) 13 protons and 14 neutrons",
      "D) 13 electrons and 14 neutrons"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The atomic number (13) equals the number of protons in the nucleus. The mass number (27) equals the sum of protons and neutrons. Therefore, the nucleus contains 13 protons and (27-13) = 14 neutrons."

      "C) 11101₃",
      "D) 10110₃"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "Converting 432₅ to base 10: (4×5²)+(3×5¹)+(2×5⁰) = 100+15+2 = 117. Converting 117 to base 3: 117 = 3⁴+2×3³+3²+0×3¹+0×3⁰ = 11100₃"

      "C) 3 s⁻¹",
      "D) 1 s⁻¹"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The frequency (rate) = speed/wavelength = 30 ms⁻¹/10 m = 3 s⁻¹."

  {
    question: "If an atom is represented as ²⁰₁₉X, which of the following deductions is correct?",
    options: [
      "A) It contains 20 protons",
      "B) It forms a covalent chloride",
      "C) Its atomic number is 39",
      "D) It is an alkali metal"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "In the notation ²⁰₁₉X, 19 is the atomic number (number of protons) and 20 is the mass number. An element with 19 protons is potassium (K), which belongs to Group 1 of the periodic table, making it an alkali metal."

      "A) 15",
      "B) 17",
      "C) 20",
      "D) 23"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",

    options: [
      "A) 4",
      "B) 2",
      "C) -2",
      "D) -4"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "Simplifying: √24 = 2√6, √96 = 4√6, √600 = 10√6. So, 2√6 + 4√6 - 10√6 = y√6, which gives y = -4."

  {
    question: "Light traveling through a small pinhole usually does not make a shadow with a distinct sharp edge because of",
    options: [
      "A) Diffraction",
      "B) Interference",
      "C) Reflection",
      "D) Refraction"
