      "C) 8",
      "D) 16"
    ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a geometric progression, the nth term is given by a_n = a₁r^(n-1), where a₁ is the first term and r is the common ratio. Given a₁ = 3 and a₅ = 28. So, 28 = 3r⁴, which gives r⁴ = 28/3, and r = (28/3)^(1/4) = 2."

      "correctAnswer": "D",
        "explanation": "For a quadratic with roots a and b, the equation is k(x - a)(x - b) = .0 With roots ½ and -1/3, we get k(x - ½)(x + 1/3) = 0. Expanding: k(x² + (1/3 - 1/2)x - 1/6) = k(x² - 1/6x - 1/6) = 0. Multiplying by 6 to clear fractions: 6k(x² - 1/6x - 1/6) = 6k(x² - x/6 - 1/6) = 0, which gives us 6kx² - kx - k = 0. Setting 6k = 6, we get k = 1, resulting in 6x² - x - 1 = 0."

    ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
        "explanation": "The buses travel in opposite directions at speeds of 72km/h and 48km/h, so their combined rate of separation is 72 + 48 = 120km/h. To find when they will be 240km apart, divide: 240km ÷ 120km/h = 2 hours. Starting at 9:00am, they will be 240km apart at 11:00am."
