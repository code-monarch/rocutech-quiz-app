    question: "An amount of N550,000.00 was realized when a principal, x was saved at 2% simple interest for 5 years. Find the value of x",
    options: [
      "A) N470,000.00",
      "B) N480,000.00",
      "C) N490,000.00",
      "D) N500,000.00"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "Using the simple interest formula: A = P(1 + rt), where A is final amount, P is principal, r is interest rate, and t is time. N550,000 = x(1 + 0.02 × 5) = x(1 + 0.1) = 1.1x. Therefore, x = N550,000/1.1 = N500,000."

      "A) Obstructed",
      "B) Nullified",
      "C) Neutralized",
      "D) Balanced"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The appellate court has nullified the decision of the lower court, meaning it canceled or invalidated the previous ruling."

      "C) 20",
      "D) 16"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "Substituting x = 3 and y = -1: 2(x² - y³) = 2(3² - (-1)³) = 2(9 - (-1)) = 2(9 + 1) = 2(10) = 20"

    question: "Two forces 6N and 8N act eastwards and northwards respectively on a body. Calculate the magnitude of their equilibrant",
    options: [
      "A) 2 N",
      "B) 7 N",
      "C) 10 N",
      "D) 14 N"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "Using the Pythagorean theorem: Resultant = √(6² + 8²) = √(36 + 64) = √100 = 10 N. The equilibrant has the same magnitude but opposite direction."

  {
    question: "A reducing agent is expected to",
    options: [
      "A) decolourise acidified KMnO₄ solution",
      "B) decolourise acidified FeSO₄ solution",
      "C) liberate Cl₂ from a chloride",
      "D) liberate CO₂ from NaHCO₃"

    question: "The defeated boxer left the ring looking extremely _______.",
    options: [
      "A) Dislocated",
      "B) Distorted",
      "C) Deserted",
      "D) Dejected"

    question: "The first term of a geometric progression (gp) is 3 and the 5th term is 28. Find the common ratio.",
    options: [
      "A) 2",
      "B) 4",
      "C) 8",
      "D) 16"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "In a geometric progression, the nth term is given by a_n = a₁r^(n-1), where a₁ is the first term and r is the common ratio. Given a₁ = 3 and a₅ = 28. So, 28 = 3r⁴, which gives r⁴ = 28/3, and r = (28/3)^(1/4) = 2."

    question: "The period of a simple pendulum of length 80.0 cm was found to be doubled when the length of the pendulum was increased by X. Calculate X.",
    options: [
      "A) 26.7 cm",
      "B) 40.0 cm",
      "C) 160.0 cm",
      "D) 240.0 cm"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "Period T ∝ √L. If T₂ = 2T₁, then √(L₂/L₁) = 2, which means L₂/L₁ = 4. So L₂ = 4L₁ = 4 × 80 = 320 cm. Therefore X = L₂ - L₁ = 320 - 80 = 240 cm."
