        "question": "In the sentence: 'I can vouch that he broke the glass accidentally and not ____', choose the word that is most nearly opposite in meaning to 'accidentally'.",
        "options": [
            "A) Forcefully",

        "question": "Find the value of x in the equation: 23x = 325",
        "options": [
            "A) 7",

            "D) 4"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "A",
        "explanation": "To solve for x, we need to understand that 23x means 23 raised to the power of x, and we need to find x where 23x = 325. Since 23 and 32 are related through their digits being reversed, we need to find the value x where 23x = 32(x-1)+5. The answer is 7."
