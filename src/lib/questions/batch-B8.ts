    question: "In each of the following sentences, there is one word or group of words in bracket. From the list of words or group of words lettered A to D, choose the one that is most nearly opposite in meaning to the word in bracket that will, at the same time correctly fill the gap in the sentence.**After grasping the [fundamental] aspects of his job Kwesi had to cope with more _____ procedures.**",
    options: [
      "A) Advanced",
      "B) Academic",
      "C) Subsidiary",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The opposite of 'fundamental' (basic, essential) is 'advanced' (complex, sophisticated)."

    question: "Nuclear fission is preferred to nuclear fusion in the generation of energy because",
    options: [
      "A) very high temperatures are required for fusion",
      "B) the raw materials for fusion are easily obtained",
      "C) energy obtained from fusion is relatively smaller",
      "D) the by-products of fusion are very dangerous"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "Nuclear fusion requires extremely high temperatures to overcome the repulsive forces between nuclei, making it currently impractical for commercial energy generation compared to fission."

    question: "Express, correct to three significant figures: 0.003597",
    options: [
      "A) 0.359",
      "B) 0.004",
      "C) 0.00360",
      "D) 0.0035"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "When rounding to three significant figures, we keep the first three non-zero digits (3, 5, 9) and round the last one (9 rounds up), giving 0.00360."

    question: "In each of the following sentences, there is one word or group of words in bracket. From the list of words or group of words lettered A to D, choose the one that is most nearly opposite in meaning to the word in bracket that will, at the same time correctly fill the gap in the sentence.**The Youth prefer discussing [contemporary] issues to _____ ones.**",
    options: [
      "A) Archaic",
      "B) Uninteresting",
      "C) Stale",
      "D) Political"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The opposite of 'contemporary' (modern, current) is 'archaic' (ancient, outdated)."

    question: "Control in nuclear reactors is effected with boron rods because the rods have the ability to",
    options: [
      "A) absorb electrons",
      "B) absorb neutrons",
      "C) accelerate electrons",
      "D) slow down neutrons"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "Boron rods are used as control rods in nuclear reactors because boron has a high neutron absorption capacity, which helps control the rate of fission."

    question: "Evaluate (0.0064)-1/3",
    options: [
      "A) 5/2",
      "B) 2/5",
      "C) -2/5",
      "D) -5/2"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "We rewrite 0.0064 as (2/5)³, then apply the exponent −1/3, which gives (2/5)−1. Taking the reciprocal, we get 5/2."

    question: "In each of the following sentences, there is one word or group of words in bracket. From the list of words or group of words lettered A to D, choose the one that is most nearly opposite in meaning to the word in bracket that will, at the same time correctly fill the gap in the sentence.**As [erroneous] as it might sound, the Headmaster's assumption was quite _____.**",

      "B) Correct",
      "C) Precise",
      "D) Faulty"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The opposite of 'erroneous' (wrong, incorrect) is 'correct' (right, accurate)."

    question: "A radioactive element has a decay constant of 0.077 s⁻¹. Calculate its half-life",
    options: [
      "A) 13.0s",
      "B) 9.0s",
      "C) 5.1s",
      "D) 0.5s"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The half-life is calculated using the formula: t₁/₂ = ln(2)/λ, where λ is the decay constant. So t₁/₂ = ln(2)/0.077 ≈ 9.0s."

  {
    question: "Simplify, correct to three significant figures, (27.63)² - (12.37)²",
    options: [
      "A) 614",
      "B) 612",
      "C) 611",
      "D) 610"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "Using the difference of squares: (27.63)² - (12.37)² = (27.63 + 12.37)(27.63 - 12.37) = 40 × 15.26 = 610.4, which rounds to 610 for three significant figures."

    question: "In which of the following states of matter do the molecules vibrate about their mean positions?",
    options: [
      "A) Liquids only",
      "B) Solids only",
      "C) Liquids and gases only",
      "D) Solids, liquids, and gases"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "In all states of matter (solids, liquids, and gases), molecules vibrate about their mean positions. The difference lies in their translational and rotational motions."
