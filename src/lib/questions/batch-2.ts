        "question": "In each of the following sentences, there is one word or group of words in brackets and one gap. From the list of words or group of words lettered A to D, choose the one that is most nearly opposite in meaning to the word in brackets or group of words that will, at the same time correctly fill the gap in the sentence. **He was promoted for his [efficiency], while his colleague was demoted for ___.**",
        "options": [
            "A) sluggishness",
            "B) disobedience",

            "D) 4.62 × 10⁻²"
        ],

        "correctAnswer": "D",
        "explanation": "Standard form is written as a × 10ⁿ where 1 ≤ a < 10. For 0.0462, we move the decimal point right to get 4.62, which requires multiplying by 10⁻², giving 4.62 × 10⁻²."

        ],

        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "explanation": "The gravitational potential energy is converted to thermal energy. Using mgh = mc∆T, where h = 126.0m, g = 10m/s², c = 4200Jkg⁻¹K⁻¹. Rearranging, ∆T = gh/c = 10 × 126.0/4200 = 0.30°C."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the ratio of good to bad oranges is 5:4, and there are 36 bad oranges, then the number of good oranges is (5/4) × 36 = 45. The total number of oranges is 45 + 36 = 81."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": "D",
        "explanation": "When an ebonite rod is rubbed with fur, electrons transfer from the fur to the ebonite rod. This makes the ebonite rod negatively charged and the fur positively charged due to the loss of electrons."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": "C",
        "explanation": "When a red-hot metal is placed in boiling water, it transfers heat energy to the water, increasing the kinetic energy of water molecules. This does not change the boiling point but increases the rate at which water molecules escape as vapor."
