    question: "In a hydraulic press, a force of 40 N is applied to the smaller piston of an area of 10 cm². If the area of the larger piston is 200 cm², calculate the force obtained.",
    options: [
      "A) 800 N",

      "B) 33.81 N",
      "C) 112.70 N",
      "D) 338.10 N"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "Upthrust = weight of liquid displaced = volume submerged × density × g = (0.046 × ¾) m³ × 980 kg/m³ × 10 m/s² = 0.0345 × 980 × 10 = 338.10 N."

    question: "Find the least value of x which satisfies the equation 4x = 7(mod 9)",
    options: [
      "A) 7",
      "B) 6",
      "C) 5",
      "D) 4"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "To solve 4x ≡ 7 (mod 9), I need to find the modular multiplicative inverse of 4 in mod 9. Since 4 × 7 ≡ 1 (mod 9), multiplying both sides by 7 gives: x ≡ 7 × 7 ≡ 49 ≡ 4 (mod 9). Therefore, the least value of x is 4"

    question: "Which of the following types of motion will be produced when a pair of equal and opposite non-collinear parallel forces acts on a body?",
    options: [
      "A) Vibrational motion",
      "B) Random motion",
      "C) Translational motion",
      "D) Rotational motion"
