        "question": "A car takes off from rest and covers a distance of 80 m on a straight road in 10 s. Calculate the magnitude of its acceleration.",
        "options": [
            "A) 1.25 m/s²",
            "B) 1.60 m/s²",
            "C) 4.00 m/s²",
            "D) 8.00 m/s²"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "C",
        "explanation": "Using the equation s = ut + ½at², where s = 80m, u = 0, t = 10s, we can solve for acceleration: 80 = 0 + ½a(10)², 80 = 50a, a = 1.6 m/s². Alternatively, using v = u + at and v² = u² + 2as: If v = at (since u = 0), then v = a×10. Also, s = ½at² = ½a×100 = 50a. Therefore, s = 80m means 50a = 80, so a = 1.6 m/s²."
