    question: "If 6, P, 14 are consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression (A.P), find the value of P.",
    options: [
      "A) 9",
      "B) 10",
      "C) 6",
      "D) 8"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "In an A.P with terms 6, P, 14, the common difference is (14-P)/1 = (P-6)/1. Solving: 14-P = P-6, which gives 2P = 20, so P = 10."

    question: "When a radioactive substance undergoes a beta decay, its",
    options: [
      "A) mass number decreases by 1",
      "B) atomic number decreases by 1",
      "C) mass number increases by 1",
      "D) atomic number increases by 1"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "In beta decay, a neutron is converted to a proton, emitting an electron. The atomic number increases by 1 while the mass number remains unchanged."

    question: "Evaluate: 2 √28 - 3 √50 + √72",
    options: [
      "A) 4√7 - √11",
      "B) 4√7 - 11√2",
      "C) 4√7 - 9√2",
      "D) 4√7"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "Simplifying: 2√(4×7) - 3√(25×2) + √(36×2) = 2(2)√7 - 3(5)√2 + 6√2 = 4√7 - 15√2 + 6√2 = 4√7 - 9√2"

    question: "A suitable reagent for distinguishing between alkanols and alkanals is",
    options: [
      "A) Bromine water",
      "B) Fehling's solution",
      "C) Sodium hydrogen trioxocarbonate (IV)",
      "D) Ammoniacal silver trioxonitrate (V)"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "Fehling's solution can distinguish between alkanols and alkanals because alkanals reduce the solution, changing its color from blue to brick-red, while alkanols do not."

    question: "If 3P = 4q and 9P = 8q - 12. Find the value of pq.",
    options: [
      "A) 12",
      "B) 7",
      "C) -7",
      "D) -12"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "From first equation: P = 4q/3. Substituting into second: 9(4q/3) = 8q - 12. Simplifying: 12q = 8q - 12, so 4q = -12, thus q = -3. Therefore P = 4(-3)/3 = -4, and pq = (-4)(-3) = 12."

      "C) 12%",
      "D) 13%"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "If 15% profit is N6900, then cost price = 6900/1.15 = N6000. At N6600, profit = 6600 - 6000 = 600. Percentage profit = (600/6000) × 100 = 10%"
